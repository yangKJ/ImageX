[**Wintersweet**](https://github.com/yangKJ/Wintersweet) is a library that quickly allows controls to play gifs and add filters.

### Features
üß¢ At the moment, the most important features of [**GIF Animatable**](https://github.com/yangKJ/Wintersweet) can be summarized as follows:

- Support full platform systemÔºåmacOS„ÄÅiOS„ÄÅtvOS„ÄÅwatchOS.
- Support add [Harbeth](https://github.com/yangKJ/Harbeth) filter.
- Support local and network play gif animated.
- Support any control and used the protocol [AsAnimatable](https://github.com/yangKJ/Wintersweet/blob/master/Sources/AsAnimatable.swift).
- Support six content filling modes.
- Support memory cache network gif data.

------

### Used

1. local gif

```
func setup(imageName: String) {
    guard let imagePath = Bundle.main.url(forResource: imageName, withExtension: "gif"),
          let data = try? Data(contentsOf: imagePath) else {
        return
    }
    let filters: [C7FilterProtocol] = [
        C7SoulOut(soul: 0.75),
        C7ColorConvert(with: .rbga),
        C7Storyboard(ranks: 2),
    ]
    imageView.play(withGIFData: data, filters: filters, preparation: {
        // do something..
    })
}
```

2. network url gif

```
func setupNetworkGif() {
    let URL = URL(string: ``URL Link``)!
    animatedView.play(withGIFURL: URL, filters: [
        C7WhiteBalance(temperature: 5555),
        C7LookupTable(image: R.image("lut_x"))
    ], loop: .count(5), cacheOption: Cached.Options.usedMemoryCache)
}
```

3. Any control implementation protocol ``AsAnimatable`` can support GIF playback.

```
class GIFView: UIView, AsAnimatable {
    
}
```

**GIF animated support has been implemented here for [ImageView](https://github.com/yangKJ/Wintersweet/blob/master/Sources/Extensions/ImageView%2BExt.swift), so you can use it directly.‚úåÔ∏è**

### AsAnimatable

- The protocol that view classes need to conform to to enable gif animated support.

```
public protocol AsAnimatable: HasAnimatable {    
    /// Total duration of one animation loop
    var loopDuration: TimeInterval { get }
    
    /// Returns the active frame if available.
    var activeFrame: C7Image? { get }
    
    /// Total frame count of the GIF.
    var frameCount: Int { get }
    
    /// Introspect whether the instance is animating.
    var isAnimatingGIF: Bool { get }
    
    /// Compute frame size for this gif.
    var gifSize: Int { get }
    
    /// Stop animating and free up GIF data from memory.
    func prepareForReuseGIF()
    
    /// Start animating GIF.
    func startAnimatingGIF()
    
    /// Stop animating GIF.
    func stopAnimatingGIF()
}
```

public two methods to play gif animated:

```
/// Prepare for animation and start play GIF.
/// - Parameters:
///   - GIFData: GIF image data.
///   - filters: Wintersweet filters apply to GIF frame.
///   - loop: Desired number of loops. Default  is ``forever``.
///   - contentMode: Content mode used for resizing the frames. Default is ``original``.
///   - bufferCount: The number of frames to buffer. Default is 50.
///   - preparation: Ready to play time callback.
///   - animated: Be played GIF.
public func play(withGIFData data: Data,
                 filters: [HFilter],
                 loop: Wintersweet.Loop = .forever,
                 contentMode: Wintersweet.ContentMode = .original,
                 bufferCount: Int = 50,
                 preparation: PreparationCallback? = nil,
                 animated: AnimatedCallback? = nil) {
    ...
}

/// Prepare for animation and start play GIF.
/// - Parameters:
///   - GIFURL: GIF image url.
///   - filters: Wintersweet filters apply to GIF frame.
///   - loop: Desired number of loops. Default  is ``forever``.
///   - contentMode: Content mode used for resizing the frames. Default is ``original``.
///   - cacheOption: Weather or not we should cache the URL response. Default  is ``disableMemoryCache``.
///   - bufferCount: The number of frames to buffer. Default is 50.
///   - preparation: Ready to play time callback.
///   - animated: Be played GIF.
///   - failed: Network failure callback.
public func play(withGIFURL: URL,
                 filters: [HFilter],
                 loop: Wintersweet.Loop = .forever,
                 contentMode: Wintersweet.ContentMode = .original,
                 cacheOption: Wintersweet.Cached.Options = .disableMemoryCache,
                 bufferCount: Int = 50,
                 preparation: PreparationCallback? = nil,
                 animated: AnimatedCallback? = nil,
                 failed: FailedCallback? = nil) {
    ...
}
```

### ContentMode

- Mainly for the image filling content to change the size.

```
/// Mainly for the image filling content to change the size.
public enum ContentMode {
    /// Dimensions of the original image.Do nothing with it.
    case original
    /// The option to scale the content to fit the size of itself by changing the aspect ratio of the content if necessary.
    case scaleToFill
    /// Contents scaled to fit with fixed aspect. remainder is transparent.
    case scaleAspectFit
    /// Contents scaled to fill with fixed aspect. some portion of content may be clipped.
    case scaleAspectFill
    /// Contents scaled to fill with fixed aspect. top or left portion of content may be clipped.
    case scaleAspectBottomRight
    /// Contents scaled to fill with fixed aspect. bottom or right portion of content may be clipped.
    case scaleAspectTopLeft
}
```

- scaleToFill: Pull up the picture to fit the size of the control, and the image will deform.

<p align="left">
<img src="Images/scaleToFill.png" width="400" hspace="15px">
</p>

- scaleAspectFit: Maintain the image width and height ratio and adapt to the maximum size of the control.

<p align="left">
<img src="Images/scaleAspectFit.png" width="400" hspace="15px">
</p>

- scaleAspectFill: Maintain the aspect ratio of the image, take the minimum edge of the image to display, and the excess surroundings will be reduced.

<p align="left">
<img src="Images/scaleAspectFill.png" width="400" hspace="15px">
</p>

- scaleAspectBottomRight: Maintain the aspect ratio of the image, take the minimum edge of the image to display, and the redundant top or left part will be reduced.

<p align="left">
<img src="Images/scaleAspectBottomRight.png" width="400" hspace="15px">
</p>

- scaleAspectTopLeft: Maintain the aspect ratio of the image and display the minimum edge of the image, and the redundant bottom or right part will be reduced.

<p align="left">
<img src="Images/scaleAspectTopLeft.png" width="400" hspace="15px">
</p>

### Cached

- Network data caching type.

```
/// Disables memory cache reads.
public static let disableMemoryCacheReads = Options(rawValue: 1 << 0)
/// Disables memory cache writes.
public static let disableMemoryCacheWrites = Options(rawValue: 1 << 1)
/// Read and write memory cache.
public static let usedMemoryCache = Options(rawValue: 1 << 2)
/// Disables both memory cache reads and writes.
public static let disableMemoryCache: Options = [.disableMemoryCacheReads, .disableMemoryCacheWrites]
```

### Loop

- Number of GIF cycles.

```
public enum Loop {
    /// Infinite cycle
    case forever
    /// Play it once.
    case never
    /// Loop the specified ``count`` times
    case count(_ count: Int)
}
```

### ImageContainer

- A single property protocol that animatable classes can optionally conform to. 
- Generally, controls with `image` attributes need to implement this protocol.

```
public protocol ImageContainer {
    /// Used for displaying the animation frames.
    var image: C7Image? { get set }
}

extension AsAnimatable where Self: ImageContainer {
    /// Returns the intrinsic content size based on the size of the image.
    public var intrinsicContentSize: CGSize {
        return image?.size ?? CGSize.zero
    }
}
```

### AssetType

- Obtain the data type and unify the type identifier UTI.

```
public enum AssetType: String, Hashable, Sendable {
    /// Unknown format. Either not enough data, or we just don't support this format.
    case unknow = "public.unknow"
    
    case jpeg = "public.jpeg"
    case png = "public.png"
    case gif = "com.compuserve.gif"
    case tiff = "public.tiff"
    
    /// Native decoding support only available on the following platforms: macOS 11, iOS 14, watchOS 7, tvOS 14.
    case webp = "public.webp"
    
    /// HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format) by Apple.
    case heic = "public.heic"
    case heif = "public.heif"
    
    /// The M4V file format is a video container format developed by Apple and is very similar to the MP4 format.
    /// The primary difference is that M4V files may optionally be protected by DRM copy protection.
    case mp4 = "public.mp4"
    case m4v = "public.m4v"
    case mov = "public.mov"
}
```

Determines a type of the image based on the given data.

```
extension AssetType {
    /// Determines a type of the image based on the given data.
    public init(data: Data?) {
        guard let data = data else {
            self = .unknow
            return
        }
        self = AssetType.make(data: data)
    }
    
    public var isVideo: Bool {
        self == .mp4 || self == .m4v || self == .mov
    }
}
```
